# Evolution of emissions of NO2 in Madrid from 2010 to 2021

## Project M2 Data Visualization by Pedro Consuegra

### 💫 Description

As pollutants, NOx are gases that are emitted in the combustion processes that are carried out in relation to traffic (especially motor vehicles, and especially diesel engines) and transport in general, as well as in high-pressure industrial facilities. temperature and power generation.

In urban environments, generally more than 75% of the NO2 in ambient air is provided by road traffic. This contribution is greater than the one it contributes to the National Emissions Inventory due to the fact that citizens live very close to road traffic, and although in terms of tonnage the emissions are lower than those of other sources, their contribution to human exposure in cities is much higher.

Last values established by the WHO:

- 10 μg/ m3 annual average


### 💿 Data

The datasets used for this project were provided by Dirección General de Sostenibilidad y Control Ambiental Subdirección General de Sostenibilidad of Madrid Goverment; and founded in kaggle: [air quality in Madrid](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raulperula/air-quality-in-madrid-20012020). I am using the data from 2010 to 2021.

### 👨🏼‍💻 Process

#### - Documentation:

Search info about NO2. The websites where I searched for information were mainly [miteco](https://www.miteco.gob.es/es/calidad-y-evaluacion-ambiental/temas/atmosfera-y-calidad-del-aire/calidad-del-aire/salud/oxidos-nitrogeno.aspx) and [Official WHO](https://www.who.int/es/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ambient-(outdoor)-air-quality-and-health#:~:text=Las%20part%C3%ADculas%20con%20un%20di%C3%A1metro,entrar%20en%20el%20sistema%20sangu%C3%ADneo.)

#### - Data/Architecture:
EDA of each .csv document (each year). Choose what I want to analyze. For this I used python 3.9 and Pandas in jupyter notebooks.


#### - Dashboard:

Create tableau project, doing a general traversal until we focus more on more special records.

### 🧐 Conclussions

Although pollution levels have dropped in the last two years, an effort is still needed to lower concentrations to healthier levels.

There are especially polluting points like Plaza Elíptica or Plaza Castilla. And others less polluting, such as Casa de Campo or Retiro, but which continue to record values that are too high.
