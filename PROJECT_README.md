# Evolution of the emissions of 2.5 and 10 micrograms particles in Madrid from 2010 to 2019

## Project M2 Data Visualization by Pedro Consuegra

### Description

The objective of this exercise is to see the evolution of the emissions of 2.5 (fine particles) and 10 (coarsed particles) micrograms particles in Madrid from 2010 to 2019 using Tableau.

Particles with a diameter of 10 microns or less (≤ PM10) can penetrate and lodge deep in the lungs, while particles with a diameter of 2.5 microns or less (≤ PM2.5) are even more harmful to health . PM2.5 can cross the lung barrier and enter the blood system. Chronic exposure to particulate matter contributes to the risk of developing cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, as well as lung cancer.

Values set by the WHO:

- Fine particulate matter (PM2.5)
> - 5 μg/m3 annual average

> - 15 μg/ m3 daily average

- Coarse particulate matter (PM10)
> - 15 μg/ m3 annual average

> - 45 μg/m3 24 daily average

### Used Data

The datasets used for this project were provided by Dirección General de Sostenibilidad y Control Ambiental Subdirección General de Sostenibilidad of Madrid Goverment; and founded in kaggle: [air quality in Madrid](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raulperula/air-quality-in-madrid-20012020). I am using the data from 2010 to 2019.
